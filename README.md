I am a state-certified technician for electrical engineering and data processing living in Aschaffenburg (Bavaria, Germany).
I also am an approved instructor for electrical craftmanship. Right now IÂ´m working to become a skilled web developer!



In my free time I like to:
- play beachvolleyball
- dive
- windsurf
- dance
